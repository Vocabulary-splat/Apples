<h1>The apple of our eye: Foodish</h1>
<p>Foodish is an API that we found on the github API list. It's a large repository of food dish images, of many types
  and origens, curated by "Surhud B."</p>
<p>The group was originally drawn to it's easy authorisation, HTTPS and CORS avilibility. Not that I (the writer)
  understand what any of that means, but github likes it.</p>
<p>This website itself, is a small showcase of what Foodish is capible of.</p>
<p>Fist up, it has many images one can use for any use</p>
<p>(3 example images)</p>
