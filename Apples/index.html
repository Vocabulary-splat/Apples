      <h1>Apples: Burgers Biryani and Dessert</h1>
      <p>
        Today we'd all like to welcome you to Apples: Burgers Biryani and Dessert, where we're a product of encroaching
        deadlines and maddness.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project started when three students were grouped together on a project, and none of them spiteful enough to
        not pull their weight, yet, not agressive enough to o the project by themseles, got together and made "Apples:
        Burgers Biryani and Dessert".
      </p>
      <p>
        While this isn't any of our best works, we've spent hours on this project, and now are excited to share it with
        the world! This is the clumination of months, and we hope it shows.
      </p>

        At the moment, all of this is possible due to the Foodish API that we found on the github API list. It's a large
        repository of food dish images of many types and origens, curated by
        "Surhud B."
      </p>
      <p>
        The group was originally drawn to it's easy authorisation, HTTPS and
        CORS avilibility. Not that I (the writer) understand what any of that
        means, but github likes it.
