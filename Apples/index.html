      <h1>The apple of our eye: Foodish</h1>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Foodish is an API that we found on the github API list. It's a large repository of food dish
        images, of many
        types and origns, curated by "Surhud B."</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The group was originally drawn to it's easy authorisation, HTTPS and CORS avilibility. Not that I
        (the writer)
        understand what any of that means, but github likes it.</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;This website itself, is a small showcase of what Foodish is capible of.</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Fist up, it has many images one can use for any use:</p>
      <h1>PLACEHOLDER, PLEASE FIX!</h1>
      <p>(3 example images)</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Then, it also has functionality to get random images:</p>
      <h1>PLACEHOLDER, PLEASE FIX!</h1>
      <p>example</p>
