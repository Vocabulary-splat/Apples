      <h1>The apple of our eye: Foodish</h1>
      <p>
        Foodish is an API that we found on the github API list. It's a large
        repository of food dish images of many types and origens, curated by
        "Surhud B."
      </p>
      <p>
        The group was originally drawn to it's easy authorisation, HTTPS and CORS
        avilibility. Not that I (the writer) understand what any of that means,
        but github likes it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website itself, is a small showcase of what Foodish is capible of.
      </p>
      <p>First up, it has many images one can use for any use</p>
