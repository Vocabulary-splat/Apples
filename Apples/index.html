<h1>The apple of our eye: Foodish</h1>
<p>
  Foodish is an API that we found on the github API list. It's a large
  repository of food dish images, of many types and origens, curated by "Surhud
  B."
</p>
<p>
  The group was originally drawn to it's easy authorisation, HTTPS and CORS
  avilibility. Not that I (the writer) understand what any of that means, but
  github likes it.
</p>
<p>This website itself, is a small showcase of what Foodish is capible of.</p>
<p>Fist up, it has many images one can use for any use</p>
<p>(3 example images)</p>
<p>Then, it also has functionality to get random images</p>
<p>example</p>
