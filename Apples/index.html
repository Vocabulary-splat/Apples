    <h1>The apple of our eye: Foodish</h1>
    <p>
      Foodish is an API that we found on the github API list. It's a large
      repository of food dish images of many types and origens, curated by
      "Surhud B."
    </p>
    <p>
      The group was originally drawn to it's easy authorisation, HTTPS and CORS
      avilibility. Not that I (the writer) understand what any of that means,
      but github likes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website itself, is a small showcase of what Foodish is capible of.
    </p>
    <p>First up, it has many images one can use for any use</p>
    <p>(3 example images)</p>
    <p>Then, it also has functionality to get random images</p>
    <p>example</p>
