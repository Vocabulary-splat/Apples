      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The foodish API is maintained by Surhad B. And he created it in 2020, as a service for websites to
        be able to
        use
        random
        food images as placeholders.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Humble beginnings</h3>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Foodish was started October 10th 2020, and had its first working version October 11th. It dealt
        with some
        Javascript
        problems, and managed to get them fixed before the monday of that week.</p>

      <h3>Consistent updating</h3>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Over time, readme.md was updated regularly, and images were added about one group every year.
        <br>
        In 2022, two new contributors were added. Angelina-tsuboi and ElijahRus250. Adding to Burger, and Pizza
        respectively.
      </p>
      <h3>Modern day</h3>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;In 2024, foodish was updated with color changing via variables. This was first implimented by
        Aman-8955, and
        was
        later
        added to the main branch of Foodish.
      <h3>Conculsions</h3>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have none.</p>
